# Elevate Your .NET APIs with the REPR Pattern and FastEndpoints

This repository showcases the implementation of the REPR pattern in .NET using the FastEndpoints NuGet package, as discussed in my Medium blog post: [Elevate Your .NET APIs with the REPR Pattern and FastEndpoints](https://medium.com/@biswajitpanday/elevate-your-net-apis-with-the-repr-pattern-and-fastendpoints-10c1b53e31b6).

## Overview

The REPR (Read-Entity-Persist-Response) pattern enhances the API development process by promoting cleaner code and better separation of concerns. This repository demonstrates how to implement this pattern in a .NET application using FastEndpoints, making it easier to create robust and maintainable APIs.

## Features

- Implementation of the REPR pattern
- Use of FastEndpoints for simplified endpoint creation
- Swagger documentation for easy API exploration
- Example CRUD operations

## Getting Started
